## Why?
Sometimes what you need is just a small lightweight Twitch chat running inside your game for your cheap PC while you do a stream for your frieds.

## Q&A
### I'll get a ban using this?
> No! This script uses [Valorant](https://github.com/techchrism/valorant-api-docs) and [Twitch.tv](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc#getting-started-with-chat--chatbots) APIs, so theoricaly will not get you a ban.

### I need administrator privileges to use this?
> No! Such privilege isn't necessary!
## How to use

1. Download latest `valorant-ingame-twitch-chat.zip` from [releases]() page;
